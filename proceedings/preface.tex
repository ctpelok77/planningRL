\section*{}

While AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning communities focus on similar
sequential decision-making problems, these communities remain somewhat unaware
of each other on specific problems, techniques, methodologies, and evaluation.

This workshop aims to encourage discussion and collaboration between the
researchers in the fields of AI planning and reinforcement learning. We aim to
bridge the gap between the two communities, facilitate the discussion of
differences and similarities in existing techniques, and encourage collaboration
across the fields. We solicit interest from AI researchers that work in the
intersection of planning and reinforcement learning, in particular, those that
focus on intelligent decision making. As such, the joint workshop program is an
excellent opportunity to gather a large and diverse group of interested
researchers.
